I am an ardent fan of the [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigm, and in particular the [Lisp family of languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)). [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) stands out in that list due to it being a modern and brilliant Lisp. It is one of the best ways to weed out accidental complexity (usually introduced by languages like Java) and worry about only the essential complexity of a problem. We are all indebted to [Rich Hickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey) for creating [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), piggy-backing on the JVM, and later [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) that targets JavaScript.

It is indeed a pleasure that some of the concepts of Functional programming has trickled into the mainstream programming languages like Java and C#. The other Functional programming languages I have dabbled with include [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/), [Racket](https://www.racket-lang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [F#](https://fsharp.org/) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) among others.

But Clojure stands out, for me at least, as the language I felt most joy coding with (with Ruby in the second place).

This interest in Functional programming flowed from perusing books and articles including [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) by Eric S. Raymond, and the excellent, thought-provoking posts by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) including [Revenge of the Nerds](https://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html) and [Beating the Averages](https://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).

Though there are a number of books, blog posts and videos on Clojure, it would be remiss if I don't mention the ones that I found most useful. In no particular order:

[Rich Hickey's greatest hits](https://changelog.com/posts/rich-hickeys-greatest-hits) -- "Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, is consistent in delivering fantastic, thought-provoking talks."

From [Uncle Bob Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin):

[Why Clojure?](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html)

[A Little Clojure](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/04/06/ALittleClojure.html)

[A Little More Clojure](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/04/09/ALittleMoreClojure.html)

Perhaps the best of these articles -- [Love Letter To Clojure (Part 1)](https://itrevolution.com/articles/love-letter-to-clojure-part-1/) by [Gene Kim](https://x.com/RealGeneKim) of the [The Unicorn Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-unicorn-project/) and [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/) fame (awesome books them, btw!).

Many Clojure books are [listed here](https://clojure.org/community/books), but the ones that I found most useful would include:

[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/) by [Bruce A. Tate](https://twitter.com/redrapids)

[Programming Clojure, Third Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj3/programming-clojure-third-edition/) by [Alex Miller](https://insideclojure.org/about/) with [Stuart Halloway](https://www.cognitect.com/authors/StuartHalloway.html) and [Aaron Bedra](https://twitter.com/abedra).

[Getting Clojure](https://pragprog.com/titles/roclojure/getting-clojure/) by [Russ Oslen](https://twitter.com/russolsen)

[Functional Design: Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.informit.com/store/functional-design-principles-patterns-and-practices-9780138176396) by [Uncle Bob Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin).

And then there are the classic Lisp books and for want of time, I am not venturing into listing them.

Happy coding and thanks for reading!
