I was pondering over the last few days over having the right kind of people in a team, _any_ team, including a Software Development team. It suddenly flashed in my mind that I had seen a quote attributed to Dravid somewhere on the same topic.

At last, I figured it out. Dravid had given a rather absorbing interview to the Cricinfo magazine that appeared in the inaugural issue (Jan 2006 issue that had Dravid on the front cover) of the magazine. This was what I was looking for:

_"The right people - and I hate to say it - not have the wrong people around them. **You don't want people whose own insecurities, whose own problems and whose own fears drag everyone else down**. That can be a big dampener in teams..._

_"...If you're going to be spending time in the team always having to cajole and look after a few people, you're doing a disservice to the rest because you're wasting and investing too much time and energy in a few people who're taking away from the group. Players need to understand that they need to give energy to the unit. There are times of course when you're not doing well and your form's not good and you'll need the support of other people. But most of the time you've got to give to the team and make sacrifices to the team and give back to the team."_
