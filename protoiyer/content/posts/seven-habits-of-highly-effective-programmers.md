Fantastic write-up on the seven habits that can help one grow as a better programmer. Aptly titled the [Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers](http://www.technicat.com/writing/programming.html "Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers") \[web archive [link here](http://web.archive.org/web/20040606015543/http://www.technicat.com/writing/programming.html)\], it is written by someone who has _been-there-done-that_. A must read for any serious programmer, or someone who cares about the craft, especially if you work in a team. There are other articles too on that site, and so check them out as well. But this is the best of the lot, as they say.
